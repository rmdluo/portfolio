# Q-Learning Snake AI

## Overview

This project implements a reinforcement learning agent that masters the classic game of Snake using deep Q-learning. The AI learns to navigate the game environment, collect food, and avoid collisions through experience and reward-based learning.

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The implementation consists of several key components:

1. **Game Environment**: A custom Snake game implementation that provides the state space and handles game mechanics
2. **Q-Learning Agent**: Deep neural network that learns state-action values
3. **Experience Replay**: Buffer to store and sample from past experiences
4. **Reward System**: Carefully designed reward structure to encourage optimal behavior

### Implementation Highlights

- Python-based implementation
- Deep Q-Network (DQN) architecture
- Experience replay for stable learning
- Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy

## Results

The agent successfully learns to play Snake, demonstrating:
- Efficient path-finding to food
- Collision avoidance
- Progressive improvement in game score

## Future Improvements

- Implement prioritized experience replay
- Add visualization of Q-values during gameplay
- Compare performance with other RL algorithms
- Optimize network architecture for better learning
